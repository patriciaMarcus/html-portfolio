<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a final year software engineering student. I'm pursueing my study at Unversiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris
  Currently I'm doing my internships at Asrix Prime Berhad, a sub-company to VCB Investment Inc. .
  It's a company based on research and development that focused on artificial intilligence and strive to
  provide a non-profit products to business, companies and commercialisation.

<p>After my internships, I will go back to my hometown which is the East part of my country. I plan to take a rest first while 
  helping my older sister babysits her childrens as she need to partake in her studies to become a veteran nurse.
  While doing so, what I mean rest is but not actually resting and relaxing. I'm planning to take my driver's license and improving
  my developer skills especially now my career goals is I want to be a full-stack developer. I also take interest in 
  learning other skills such as business, video graphic, a freelance developer, learning instruments such as eletric guitar. 
  I realised that world is fast-pacing and advancing day by day with different and new technologies that appears nowadays. That makes me 
  wanna learn new things and strive to adapt to these new technologies to enhance my career and skills when I'm job hunting next year.

<p>If I ever retired and live my life to the fullest, I would open a flower shops and becomes a florist
  where I live with a dog and a cat in an apartment. That would be a lovely ending.
