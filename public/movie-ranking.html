<h1>Best Movies by Patricia</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movie all the time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Law Abiding Citizen</h3>
<p>It questions the lines of morality in your life. Showing how reality works and you never know which is right and which is wrong.</p>

<h3>The Longest Yard</h3>
<p>It's a nice comedy and sportmanship movie to me. It lights up my mood.</p>

<h3>Raid Redemption</h3>
<p>The first best Southasian action movie I've watched as they hire actors that can really act and making use the budget and the plot was amazing too.</p>
